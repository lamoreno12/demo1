Homework 2

The folder contains the different labs from Zybooks 
All the labs and homework contains different topics seen in class
Some of the topics use whrere loops: as for loops, nested loops, break.
There is aslso the Define function including their parameter values and return function
Follow by string formating and the reading/writting files, including the with statement.

The project is useful because we can see in action how the code is working, how we can implement centain variables to find the information we want.
It also makes us think the different ways we can implement what we have learn and put into action.

To start with the project the labs are the first think to do, because it has pieces of the different modules are learn in class,
while sometimes are tricky, they include the material and make people think what kind of code is need it. The homework at the end, is
what combines all the different materials from zybooks and make it one.

For the creation of the project the information is mainly from zybooks, with the help of tutorialspoint, w3shools and examples of how to implement 
the varibales and functions.
