Homework 3

The folder contains the different labs, in these case the labs are focuse in zybook only labs, not additional exercise.
Some of the topics cover where how to implement classes and constructors from a given file. The importance of definin each method with
the corresponding paramenter if a method is not define then a error is emited because it doesnt match or the number of parameters are not the same.
Classes are used throught all the labs to declare the different statments that will be used whenever the user enter the information
in the main plataform.

The project labs are useful because we can implement the use of filters, sort, and list can facilitate the way the code is read and format, 
little changes that make the code easier to use. In the case of the shopping cart a lot of attributes and methods where need it to 
specified what the user really wants to do. Different options but different methods and variables that need to be use.  

Labs can be consider examples of the information provide by zybooks, include material and let us think what is need it in the code. 
Information from zybooks, examples of how to implement the variables and functions.
