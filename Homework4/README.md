Homework 4

The folder contains the different labs from Zybooks. All the labs contains different topics seen in class. 
Some of the topics used where Exceptions and how to handle them, it helps to check and revise for any erros in the code
The is also sorting algorithm and checking for selection of the input, if a input is selected then the code will go through
and check the correct and new sorting selection.

The project is useful because we can see in action how the code is working, how to implement different variables and get the 
information we nedd. It also make us think the different ways we can implement what we have learn and put into action.

The start of the project reading and practicing can be used to understad how the function works depending in what is need it.
Sometimes they are tricky, but in the end it combines all the different materials from Zybooks in one.

For the creation the infomration is mainly from zybooks, and examples on how implements the functions and variables.
